# 📚 Mini RAG Project – Smart Answer Buddy 🤖

This mini project demonstrates a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using your own documents (like PDFs) to answer questions intelligently with the help of OpenAI's GPT model. It's a beginner-friendly, Jupyter-based implementation — designed to feel like you're building magic with code!

---

## 🚀 What is RAG?

**RAG = Retrieval + Generation**

🔍 First, it **retrieves** the most relevant content from your documents  
🧠 Then, it uses **Generative AI** (GPT-3.5) to generate a clear, smart answer  

In short: it’s like building your own ChatGPT that reads your notes before replying!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)
- [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) – for vector storage
- [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com)
- PyPDF2 – to read PDF documents

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install openai langchain faiss-cpu PyPDF2 tiktoken

## 📄 How to Use

1. 🔑 Get your OpenAI API Key from [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
2. 🧠 Upload a PDF document (like study notes or company policies)
3. 💬 Ask any question based on that document
4. 🤖 See GPT generate a contextual answer after retrieving relevant content

---

## ✅ Sample Question

```
Enter a question: What is RAG in NLP?

Answer:
RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It enhances LLMs by allowing them to retrieve relevant information from external sources before generating responses, increasing accuracy and reducing hallucination.
```
